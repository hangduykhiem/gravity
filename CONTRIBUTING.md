### Pull requests only
Please **DON'T** push directly to the master branch. Always use feature branches to give people (including the maintainers) an opportunity discuss your proposed changes.

Pull requests will be merged after all discussions have been concluded and at least two reviewers have given their approval.

### Guidelines
- **every change** needs a test
- 100% code coverage
- keep the current code style
